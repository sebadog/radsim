    summaryOfPathology: "In addition to the severe spinal canal and foraminal stenosis at L4-L5, this case illustrates a sacral insufficiency fracture with fracture lines along the bilateral sacral alae and a horizontal sclerotic component at S2. Sacral insufficiency fractures often present with lower back, pelvic, or buttock pain and may be missed on radiographs and CT. CT scans can reveal linear fracture lines or sclerosis in the sacral ala and sacral body, often forming an \"H-shaped\" pattern. MRI is highly sensitive, showing low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2/STIR images due to bone marrow edema. Bone scintigraphy also aids in diagnosis with increased radiotracer uptake in an \"H\" pattern.",

    summaryOfPathology: "Transdiscal fractures in a rigid spine, often seen in conditions like ankylosing spondylitis or diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), are serious injuries. The rigidity of the spine increases the risk of fractures extending through the intervertebral disc and adjacent vertebrae. These fractures can lead to severe pain, spinal instability, and neurological deficits. CT and MRI are usually required to assess the full extent of the injury. Prompt and appropriate management is essential to stabilize the spine and prevent further complications.",

    summaryOfPathology: "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, originating in the cells lining the tubules of the kidney. It often does not cause symptoms in its early stages and may be incidentally discovered during imaging tests performed for other reasons, such as in this case where it was detected during a CT scan of the lumbar spine. RCC can spread to other organs and tissues, making early detection and treatment crucial for better outcomes. Radiologically, it appears as a solid renal mass with various enhancing patterns on contrast-enhanced CT scans. RCC can be heterogeneous in appearance, often demonstrating areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or calcification. It frequently extends into the renal vein and can spread to adjacent structures such as the renal sinus, perinephric fat, and lymph nodes. Radiologists should meticulously examine the paraspinal soft tissues and corners of the images to avoid missing crucial findings.",

      "Post-obstructive opacification of the right frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses."
    ],
    summaryOfPathology: "Sinonasal masses encompass a spectrum of pathologies, ranging from benign inflammatory polyps to potentially malignant tumors. These masses typically appear on CT scans as soft tissue densities within the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Benign polyps often present as smoothly marginated, non-enhancing masses, while more aggressive or malignant lesions may demonstrate irregular borders, bony erosion, and contrast enhancement. Sinonasal masses often present with nonspecific symptoms such as nasal obstruction, sinusitis-like symptoms, or epistaxis. Imaging modalities like CT scans are crucial for initial detection and monitoring of these masses. However, their interpretation can be complex, especially when lesions are partially visualized or overlooked due to their subtle appearance. In this instance, the delayed diagnosis underscores the importance of thorough radiological review and clinical follow-up, as timely detection can significantly impact treatment outcomes and patient prognosis.",

    summaryOfPathology: "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Parkinsonism, autonomic dysfunction, cerebellar, and pyramidal symptoms. MSA-P, the predominant subtype, primarily manifests with Parkinsonism and minimal cerebellar signs initially. Brain MRI plays a pivotal role in identifying specific features of MSA-P. Notably, MRI often reveals putaminal changes and infratentorial atrophy. The putaminal hyperintense rim sign observed on T2-weighted images is a key characteristic (T2 putaminal rim sign). This finding, while highly specific for MSA-P, can occasionally be encountered in other neurodegenerative conditions or even in healthy individuals, highlighting the importance of integrating clinical and radiological findings for accurate diagnosis and management of MSA-P.",
