  # Fix Cases Table RLS Policies

  1. Changes
    - Remove overly restrictive INSERT policy
    - Add new INSERT policy with proper validation
    - Simplify UPDATE policy conditions
    
  2. Security
    - Maintains RLS enabled
    - Only authenticated users can perform operations
    - Ensures basic data validation while being less restrictive
